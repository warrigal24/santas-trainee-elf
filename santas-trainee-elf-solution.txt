Solution by Garry Francis
----------------------------------------
This is a minimal solution to a large game. Your goal is to complete ten tasks for Santa Claus. Two of these are chores and eight of these are finding or making presents for eight children. The early part of the game is essentially an information gathering exercise. You need to find out exactly what the two chores are, find out exactly what presents are required for the children and find out what materials you need to make the presents. In doing so, you'll need to EXAMINE lots of things, talk to all the characters and ask them about various things. There are lots of things to do, lots of things to try and lots of areas to explore. If you get really desperate, type HINT to access the context-sensitive hint system.

Scores are shown in parentheses as +A=B, where A is points earned and B is cumulative points earned. You achieve 10 points for completing each of the two chores, five points for finding or making each of the eight presents and a further five points for placing each of the presents on Santa's sleigh.

There are various ways to approach the game. In the solution below, I have opted to gather all the required materials for the presents and drop them in the assembly area, then make all the toys at the end. In doing so, I have gathered everything indoors first, then everything outdoors, completing the other two chores along the way. Other approaches are equally valid. Incidentally, as your inventory is limited to ten items, don't waste your time carrying around items that you don't need.

I have included many optional (but sometimes significant) commands in parentheses. You can omit these once you know what to do. There are many other commands not shown. Make sure you note the extra things to try once you've completed the game, then replay it to try all the things you may have missed. Some of these are quite funny.

So, here we go on a really fun, family-friendly game...
