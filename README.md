# Santa's Trainee Elf

By Garry Francis

## Background

It's 23 December 2020.

It's been a really tough year for many people with bush fires, floods and other natural disasters and then the Covid-19 pandemic. Many people are doing it tough, so it's up to Santa Claus to bring a smile to their faces and make sure that all the nice children get a present on Christmas Day, even if their parents can't afford it.

Today also happens to be your birthday. You have just turned 16, which is the elvish coming-of-age. It's a very proud day when Santa's elves start their traineeship.

You've been told to report to Santa in the lounge room to receive your instructions for your first day on the job. Good luck, young Eldrid.

This is a traditional text adventure that was originally written for the [Adventuron Christmas Jam](https://itch.io/jam/an-adventuron-christmas-jam), 17 November to 23 December 2020.

## Release notes
